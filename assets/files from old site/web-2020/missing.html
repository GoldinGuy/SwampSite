  <title>404 ERROR</title>
</head>
<body>
  &lt;-- On any given Web server, numerical codes are used to
  represent various server (or Web site) errors. The 404 error
  represents a Web site's failure to find a page sought by a
  visitor. Generally, there are two causes for a 404 error: 1) the
  page does not exist at all, or 2) the page name was misspelled by
  the visitor on his/her browser (or by you in your Web development
  tool). The 404 error page is thus the Web page that displays on a
  browser whenever the error is triggered. --&gt; &lt;-- To disable
