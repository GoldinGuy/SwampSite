<p class="style3">4-19-07 - Well it was another fantastic year for team 179. We had a  smaller team, but a big showing. We made it to the finals of UCF and then ran  through our division finals at the World Championship all the way to the big  stage - Einstein. I never thought one way or the other that we could make it  that far. My mind has always been set on being positive and focused on the  possibilities, but just one match at a time. These competitions are set up to  favor very few individual capabilities, but rely heavily on the 3 team alliance  capabilities. In order for 1 team to control their destiny all the way through  would be a miracle. Yet we were chosen by a team that had such strength in  every aspect that our chances became a reality. Not only did this amazing team  (233) choose us, they also chose the 4 time world champions team 71. It was a  dream team alliance. Going into these final matches, we never took anything for  granted. We knew we had to fight every alliance with all of our collective  capability. Our team went through the Florida  regional and all of seeding with 1 real job, score. But when we had our first  discussion with PINK after being selected, they chose us for our defense. Which  we (us and 1902) demonstrated to them during the semi-finals at UCF when we  beat their alliance 2 on 3 by playing defense. We also had an opportunity to  play defense against another team (223) during seeding matches on Archimedes.  PINK's scouts witnessed this and therefore chose us for their alliance to do  just that. It just so happened that was Sean's favorite thing to do.<br>
  &nbsp;So off we went into  the Archimedes finals. Each match we would each pick a team to watch in each  quarter, and semi. We were looking for who was the biggest scoring threat.  After each match we would all report back and they would formulate a strategy  and we would get our target. Sean sure handedly denied nearly all scoring all  the way through the Archimedes finals. I don't think we realized how well we  were doing. All in a flash it was over and we won our way to Einstein. This is  a dream come true for all of the drive teams in FIRST!<br>
  &nbsp;For me, that was all  I could imagine. I never even thought of what would come after that. Now we  play even more? Over there in front of ALL OF FIRST? OK lets get back to  work... Immediately Brian Beatty from 71 ran off to get scouting info from each  division. 180's &quot;Bruce Trembly&quot; came and gave us info on the Curie  alliance. Other info came in from each division and we began looking each other  over as we camped out and found pit parking. We were relaxing behind the stage  and realized our bot was gone and so was everyone else. Then as we started to  look, someone told us the parade was about to start. So we scrambled over there  and found everyone lined up and paired in alliances with a guy telling everyone  where to go and what to do. Each division&rsquo;s announcer was asking details about  each team so they could announce us as &quot;their team&quot;. Our guy, not  sure what his name is, does all the flips and kicks with the blue hair was so  soar from doing that for 3 days, he just hobbled around like an angry mob just  beat him with pipes. Out we went with the drum marching band. Pretty cool,  everyone was bobbing to the beat. The crowd somehow doesn't look that huge from  the floor, not sure why, but there were maybe 15,000 - 20,000 people there.  Well we waited through announcements and awards and then the Newton  and Galileo divisions went first. They played hard defense against each other.  Very little scoring, and Galileo won it. Our partners from UCF 1902 were the Alliance  captains and we were proud of them, we thought with that win, they were going  to the final match. Now it was our turn, and we had to play the mighty beach  bots 330 and 1270 the team that beat us at the UCF finals. We didn't know what  to expect, but we played our strategy that got us there. It worked, a win,  although our partner 71 was flipped and the opposing alliance was DQ'd, we  still had more points than they did anyway. After that match Newton  pulled an upset on Galileo and they were tied, it was a squeaker. So back on  the field against the 330 alliance again. As we worked on keeping 330 from  scoring, 1270 came alive and scored O plenty. Luckily they left our partners  alone and they got a few more on than 1270 did. However at the end of this  match Sean made a mad dash to the 71 ramp with 6 seconds on the clock from  halfway across the field. It was as if the robot had a mind of its own, there  could not have been a more beautifully executed trip onto that ramp. The whole  place went nuts. The video shows our robot actually catching air as it crested  the top of the ramp at full speed. I had to give Sean a Man hug and tell him  how beautiful that was. Then we watched intently the last match, as Galileo  pulled off an upset for the win. We saw our target, 987. Well on the field  again, the robot had its wounds but she was ready to rumble. This is the moment  when a man becomes intimate with machine. I wanted to kiss it, but I resisted -  too many people watching.... OK everything is check, we do the team  introductions and 3.2.1 go. This match is strikingly like all the others, good  defense, our team is scoring fast and the rack is our color, looking good. Out  comes 987 with a spoiler. Sean somehow held them off till the buzzer and we won  with ringers, nobody climbed. Well the next match against the winners looked  more like our Archimedes matches with both teams scoring but 71 couldn't get  their ramp out for us to climb. 233 got on, but we lost by 15 or so points as  they had 2 up on their ramps. The last match came again down to the last  seconds for us to get on the ramp, however 987 amazingly managed to score a few  ringers under our stringent defense and also placed a ringer on the ramp which  we were to climb. We attempted to hold 987 on our side of the field to keep  them from getting to their ramp however they got away. So as Sean approached the  ramp he saw the ringer there and panicked. I told him to go anyway so he  favored the inside edge thinking it would move out as he climbed. However this  caused him to get hung up and beached on the ramp so our wheels lost contact to  the ground. There were 6 seconds on the clock, and we already knew it was over.  71 was screaming at 233 to back off the ramp so they could jiggle us free, but  nothing moved. It was over.... As the buzzer rang, it was a reality, looking  across they had 2 on top of team 190 and the ringers didn't matter as there  weren't enough in a row.<br>
  &nbsp;From then on everyone  came around to give the half congratulatory 1 liners like, &quot;almost&quot;  and &quot;can you believe it&quot; etc. Inside somehow I was thrilled and awed  by it all. The fact that we lost only mattered a little bit. I think it hurt  233 and 71 as they had been this close before. I can't even imagine being there  again, but these teams make it their routine. All I can say now is I hope in my  mind going forward all that matters is we did good, and these students were  inspired. I love this stuff!</p>

<p class="style3"> 2/20/2007 - We shipped the Swamp Lobster today! at this moment I can't think of a single thing that needs to be done to the robot. When we get to competition we can go straight through inspection. I also anticipate 0 problems! This will be a first. Our team did a fantastic job the season, everyone worked very hard. I'm very proud of this team. I believe we are going to have a smooth bunch of matches as well. Thanks to everyone! Now lets go back to those things we had 6 weeks ago... um lives, yah those, remember those?</p>

2/9/2007 - Well we've basically finished the design of the robot. It seems to drive, score and ramp well. We've had to get 8 lbs out of it but we're still playing with another lb or 2 to get under the 120 weight limit. We've changed the gripper design and will continue gripper experiments until we hit on the best arrangement. The software team will have the robot over the weekend for the most part. They have succesfully scored in autonomous on our woody bot. Next weekend we will have our scrimmage with other local teams at our shop, this will start at 10:00am Sat. until 4:00pm. There will be food, fun and the Sun Sentinel will be out for reporting! Please come and join us.</p>

<p class="style3">1/26/2007 -OK we're 1/2 way into the 2007 season and now may be a good time to report on where we are... The robot is designed. We're planning to finish welding tommorow 1/27/2007 
and hopefully paint it this Sunday. Our shop finally has internet. The animation team has a story board. The software team has lots of projects going with IR sensors and also using the gyro for heading. We may not use the camera this year and instead hunt for the spider legs to score on. This will be the first year ever that Swampthing intends to play a more defensive role. Ous game scenarios and strategies have shown us that scoring is very difficult while being defensed, and the option for ramp points at the end is very important. <br> 
We may lose our Pratt and Whitney funding next year which will be a drastic blow to our team. Hopefully the financial future of our primary sponsor will improve before next year. We're very grateful for their past support, and EDF's as well.</p>
