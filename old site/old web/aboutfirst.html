<center><b>FIRST: For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology</b></center>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIRST was founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen. FIRST was created as a way to help form strong bonds between students, adults, and the community itself. FIRST allows students to work alongside engineers, teachers, and other volunteers to accomplish an incredible task -- to design, build, and ship a robot in just six weeks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does FIRST stand for? FIRST stands for our future. It stands for educating  our youth to succeed. Most of all, it stands for giving students the chance to do something they love -- and do it well. FIRST has changed the lives of many people on Team 179. What does FIRST stand for to us? Just look at the faces of our team members. Looks of hope, aspiration, and dreams are what you see. All thanks to FIRST.
