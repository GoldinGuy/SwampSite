</center>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations teams! Everybody played their hearts out in drizzly Columbia, South Carolina two weeks ago!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many teams complained that the rules were a little bit strict; as they were, compared to other regionals. This really made the competition an uphill battle for everyone. With two of the best alliance teams out there, Swamp Thing managed to pull away in first place once again! <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll now be heading to Nationals this Wednesday! Congratulations, teams!</font><font size="2" face="verdana">

</center>
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean Kamen strikes again! The 2005 game for FIRST Robotics was announced today through an international satellite feed provided by NASA. This year's game is as complicated as the last. The game features two groups of three robots competing to stack pyramid-shaped pieces and align them in rows. Think Tic-Tac-Toe, only three-dimensional.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video of the 2005 FIRST Robotics game kickoff can be found
